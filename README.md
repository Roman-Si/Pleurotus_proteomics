# Pleurotus_proteomics
Code and data for the proteomics analysis of *Pleurotus pulmonarius* LGAM 28684 grown with different substrates (xylose, corn stover, beechwood).  
Code is in quarto documents (.qmd). Will provide the rendered version in html as well.  

Protein functional annotations were performed with the [ProtAnnoScripts](https://github.com/Roman-Si/ProtAnnoScripts) package. Quantitative proteomics analysis with [Rscripts_for_proteomics](https://github.com/Roman-Si/Rscripts_for_proteomics).  
All plots were initially created with ggplot2 and then edited in Inkscape.
